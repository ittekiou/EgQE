# 4. Falling and Supporting — Gravity Is Not Attraction

Falling motion is often regarded as the most elementary manifestation of gravity.  
A body released in a gravitational field accelerates downward, following a predictable trajectory.  
This regularity has encouraged the widespread identification of gravity with attraction:  
a force pulling bodies toward one another.

Yet this identification conceals a fundamental asymmetry.

A freely falling body experiences no weight.  
The sensation of heaviness arises only when falling is **prevented**—when the body is supported.  
This fact is usually treated as a curiosity or deferred to discussions of the equivalence principle, but it reveals a deeper structural problem: **if gravity were merely attraction, support should not be necessary.**

The necessity of support indicates that what we call “weight” is not the manifestation of an attractive force, but the emergence of a **relational demand** that must be continuously compensated.

In a freely falling system, relational updates between the body and its environment remain synchronized.  
No persistent discrepancy accumulates.  
In contrast, when a body is held at rest relative to another structure—such as the ground—this synchronization fails.  
The environment continues to update, while the body is constrained not to.  
The resulting mismatch does not vanish; it must be actively sustained.

We identify this mismatch as **lag**.

Weight, in this view, is not a force exerted downward, but the **cost of maintaining a non-updating relation** in an environment that continues to update.  
Support is therefore not the negation of gravity, but its most direct manifestation:  
the site where lag becomes localized and non-recoverable.

This reinterpretation dissolves the apparent paradox between falling and standing.  
There is no need to invoke two different mechanisms—force during motion and constraint during rest.  
Both situations are governed by the same underlying structure: the presence or absence of recoverable lag.

The equivalence principle follows naturally.  
In free fall, lag is not accumulated and thus not registered.  
In supported systems, lag is continuously generated and must be compensated.  
The equality of inertial and gravitational mass is not a coincidence of forces, but a reflection of how lag is inscribed and resisted.

From this perspective, gravity is not attraction.  
It is the persistence of irreducible relational lag under constrained update conditions.

# **5. The Two-Body Problem Revisited — Limit Cycles of Lag**

The two-body problem is commonly regarded as one of the great successes of classical mechanics.  
Given initial positions and velocities, the future motion of two gravitating bodies can be expressed in closed analytical form.  
Ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas emerge as elegant solutions, reinforcing the idea that gravitational motion is fundamentally solvable.

However, this solvability rests on a crucial interpretive assumption:  
that the system’s periodicity implies closure.

From the perspective of SAW, this assumption is precisely where the illusion arises.

In a two-body system, relational lag does not vanish.  
Rather, it is continuously regenerated and continuously recovered.  
Orbital motion is not the elimination of lag, but its **circulation**.

The closed trajectory of an orbit should therefore not be interpreted as a return to an identical state.  
Although the spatial position may repeat, the relational history does not.  
This can be stated minimally as:

$$  
\phi \neq 0 \quad \text{even when} \quad \oint d\mathbf{x} = 0  
$$

The integral closure of position does not imply the erasure of relational offset.  
The system remains dynamically coherent because this offset is neither allowed to accumulate irreversibly nor forced to vanish.  
Instead, it is confined to a **limit cycle**.

In this sense, the two-body problem is not solved because its lag disappears, but because lag remains bounded.  
Orbital stability is not the result of force balance, but of **lag circulation**.

This reinterpretation clarifies why two-body motion admits analytic expressions.  
The system’s degrees of freedom are sufficiently constrained that lag cannot fragment.  
It is compelled into a single recurring mode.  
The orbit is thus a fossilized trace of successful lag recovery.

Seen this way, the two-body problem was never a proof of complete predictability.  
It was a special case in which irreversibility is hidden inside a stable geometric form.

The apparent solvability of the two-body problem is therefore not fundamental.  
It is contingent on the confinement of lag to a single cycle.

# **6. The Many-Body Problem Revisited — Distributed and Unrecoverable Lag**

The classical many-body problem is said to be unsolvable because it lacks sufficient conserved quantities.  
As the number of interacting bodies increases, analytic solutions disappear, and chaotic behavior dominates.  
This is usually presented as a mathematical limitation.

SAW reframes this failure as structural rather than technical.

In systems with three or more interacting bodies, lag can no longer be confined to a single recovery cycle.  
Relational updates propagate across multiple interacting pathways, each with its own timing and orientation.  
Lag does not circulate; it **branches**.

Once lag becomes distributed, no global closure condition exists.  
There is no privileged loop into which all relational offsets can be absorbed.  
Instead, lag accumulates locally, migrates, and interferes with other lag histories.

This is the origin of sensitivity to initial conditions.  
What is amplified is not positional error, but **unrecoverable relational divergence**.  
Small differences in early relational updates generate qualitatively distinct lag distributions over time.

From this viewpoint, chaos is not randomness.  
It is the structural signature of lag that cannot be globally recovered.

The absence of general analytic solutions in the many-body problem thus reflects a deeper fact:  
there is no single relational cycle capable of absorbing all offsets.  
The system does not fail to conserve energy or momentum.  
It fails to conserve **relational synchrony**.

This also explains why numerical simulations remain effective locally but fail globally.  
Numerical integration tracks trajectories, not relational histories.  
As lag distributions proliferate, simulation becomes a record of divergence rather than prediction.

The many-body problem was therefore never “unsolved” in principle.  
It was misidentified.  
What was sought was a closed-form solution where no closed relational structure exists.

In contrast to the two-body case, where lag is confined to a stable loop,  
many-body systems generate a **lag field** with no natural boundary.

This distinction completes the reinterpretation.

- Two-body systems appear solvable because lag circulates.
    
- Many-body systems appear unsolvable because lag disperses.
    

The difference is not quantitative, but syntactic.

## 🔑 核心まとめ

- 二体問題  
    → **lag が極限環に閉じ込められている**
    
- 多体問題  
    → **lag が分散し、回収不能になる**
    
- 「解ける／解けない」は  
    → 数学的能力の差ではなく  
    → **構文的構造の差**
