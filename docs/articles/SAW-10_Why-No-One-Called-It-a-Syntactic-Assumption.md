# Why No One Called It a Syntactic Assumption

### On the Constancy of the Speed of Light

## Abstract

The constancy of the speed of light has long been treated as a foundational principle of modern physics. This paper argues that such treatment reflects not a logical necessity nor an empirical inevitability, but a syntactic choice: a decision about how physical descriptions are organized. Rather than disputing the validity or utility of the assumption, this work asks a different question—why it was never named as such. By examining historical, conceptual, and linguistic factors, we show that the absence of a syntactic vocabulary prevented the reassignment of its epistemic status. The goal is not to revise relativity, but to clarify the grammatical role played by its most famous postulate.

## 1. Introduction

The statement that the speed of light in vacuum is invariant for all inertial observers is commonly introduced as a _principle_.  
It is not derived.  
It is not explained.  
It is assumed.

This paper does not challenge the assumption’s empirical adequacy, predictive success, or historical importance. Instead, it addresses a narrower and more structural question:

**Why has this assumption never been described as syntactic?**

The issue at stake is not whether the assumption is true, but what _kind_ of statement it is. The distinction matters because misclassification at the level of syntax propagates downstream—into interpretation, explanation, and ontology.

## 2. Proximity Without Naming

### 2.1 Einstein

The constancy of the speed of light was introduced as a principle, motivated by the failure of classical kinematics to accommodate electrodynamics. Its role was primarily _organizational_: to stabilize the transformation rules between observers.

In later reflections, Einstein expressed dissatisfaction with principle-based formulations, suggesting a preference for constructive explanations. Yet even there, the invariant speed of light was not demoted in status; it remained a foundational axiom. The discomfort was acknowledged, but the category itself remained unquestioned.

### 2.2 Poincaré

Poincaré explicitly characterized simultaneity as a convention and understood measurement protocols as coordinated choices rather than discoveries. He came close to recognizing the invariant speed of light as a rule embedded in measurement syntax.

However, the language of convention stopped short of a more general grammatical classification. Convention still implies choice _within_ a theory, not the syntactic scaffolding that enables the theory to be written at all.

### 2.3 Constructive Interpretations

Lorentz-type approaches treated light-speed invariance as an emergent phenomenon rather than a principle. Yet the explanatory effort remained causal and physical: searching for mechanisms beneath the invariance.

The syntactic question—_why this invariance must be placed at the level of transformation grammar_—was never asked.

### 2.4 Contemporary Philosophy

Modern discussions distinguish between principle theories and constructive theories, or between explanation and redescription. These debates sharpened conceptual clarity but retained the same categories: principle, law, convention, geometry.

The term _syntax_—as a classification of descriptive rules independent of ontological commitment—was never introduced.

## 3. Why the Name Never Appeared

### 3.1 Mathematical Overdetermination

The formal success and aesthetic power of Minkowski spacetime made the underlying assumption appear _explained_. Geometry seemed to replace grammar. Once the equations worked, the syntactic decision that enabled them disappeared from view.

### 3.2 Fear of Structural Collapse

Reclassifying the constancy of light speed from principle to assumption appeared to threaten the entire theoretical edifice. Time dilation, length contraction, relativistic causality—all seemed to depend on it.

As a result, discussions rarely stopped at the level of _epistemic status_. Critique jumped directly to replacement or rejection, which discouraged careful reclassification.

### 3.3 Absence of Syntactic Vocabulary

Physics possessed words for laws, principles, constants, and hypotheses—but not for the rules governing _how descriptions are written_. Without a grammatical category for such rules, the invariant speed of light had nowhere else to go.

The result was conceptual inertia.

---

## 4. Reclassification Without Revision

Calling the constancy of the speed of light a **syntactic assumption** does not deny its effectiveness. It restores proportionality.

- It is not a causal agent.
    
- It is not an observed invariant.
    
- It is a rule that constrains how observers are related in description.
    

This reclassification does not modify predictions. It modifies interpretation. It clarifies that the assumption operates _prior_ to dynamics and _independently_ of ontology.

In this sense, the statement “the speed of light is invariant” functions grammatically, not physically.

---

## 5. Conclusion

The invariant speed of light was never false.  
It was never misguided.  
It was never even questioned in the right way.

It was simply never named for what it is.

By restoring it to the status of a syntactic assumption, we gain a clearer view of what relativity does—and what it does not claim to explain. The task is not to overthrow a theory, but to correct its grammar.

> It was not an error of physics.  
> It was an absence of vocabulary.
