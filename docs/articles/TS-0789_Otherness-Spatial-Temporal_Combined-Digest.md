# Otherness, Spatial Expansion, and Temporal Irreversibility

Time, space, and otherness are not treated here as independent ontological domains.  
They are reinterpreted as structurally emergent modes of a prior condition: non-closure differential (lag).

When lag becomes recursively preservable, time emerges.  
When lag becomes configurationally distributed, space emerges.  
Otherness is not primarily a subject or social role, but the structural mediation that couples preservation and expansion.

What follows articulates this generative sequence:  
SO as relational ground;  
lag as non-closure differential;  
otherness as structural mediation of lag;  
space as expanded differential;  
time as preserved differential.

## Abstract

This paper proposes a structural account of time, space, and otherness grounded in non-closure dynamics. Lag is defined as relational differential that cannot be fully closed. When lag becomes recursively preservable (ψ-condition), temporal irreversibility emerges. When lag becomes configurationally distributed (Axis-condition), spatial extension emerges. Otherness is not primarily a subject or social role but the structural mediation that couples preservation and expansion. Time and space are shown to be dual modes of the same differential process.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional accounts treat:

- time as a linear parameter,
    
- space as an extended container,
    
- otherness as a social or intersubjective category.
    

This paper repositions all three within a structural non-closure framework.

---

## 2. Lag as Non-Closure Differential

Lag is the minimal structural difference within relation.

It is not error, delay, or deviation, but structural non-closure.

---

## 3. Temporal Emergence (TS-07–08)

Time emerges when lag satisfies recursive preservation:

$$  
x^3 = x^2 + x + 1  
$$

This ψ-condition ensures:

- structure retention,
    
- relational continuity,
    
- trace stabilization.
    

Irreversibility arises when preservation becomes finitely grounded (Z₀ exposure).

Thus, time = preserved differential.

---

## 4. Spatial Generation (TS-09)

Space emerges when lag is externalized across relational configurations.

Spatiality is configurational distribution of differential.

Thus, space = expanded differential.

---

## 5. Otherness as Structural Mediation

Otherness is not primarily:

- an interacting subject,
    
- a content of consciousness,
    
- a social role.
    

Otherness is the structural mediation that:

1. externalizes lag (spatial opening),
    
2. demands its preservation (temporal emergence).
    

Otherness binds space and time.

---

## 6. Main Theorem (Structural Form)

Time and space are dual structural modes of lag.

- Preserved lag → time
    
- Expanded lag → space
    

Otherness structurally couples both processes.

---

## 7. Conclusion

Temporal irreversibility and spatial extension are not independent ontological domains.

They are structurally coupled outcomes of non-closure dynamics.

Otherness is the mediating condition of this coupling.
