## Abstract（EgQE version｜300–350 words）

Field theory has historically functioned as a powerful stabilizing framework, enabling the preservation of fundamental equations by introducing the field as a mediating background. While successful, this approach implicitly fixes the syntactic conditions under which phenomena are described. Consequently, deviations and indeterminacies are treated as probabilistic effects or as properties of the field itself, without addressing the generative origin of the descriptive framework.

This paper advances **ZURE-field theory** as a syntactic turn beyond conventional field theory. The ZURE-field is defined as a domain in which complete coherence is structurally impossible from the outset, such that accidental generation necessarily persists. In this domain, constraints are simultaneously the results of generative processes and the conditions that constrain subsequent generation. The ZURE-field therefore exhibits a temporal, historical, and irreversible circulation.

To formalize this structure, we introduce two complementary concepts. **R₀** denotes an unarticulable generative domain that cannot be exhaustively captured by syntax or formalization. **Z₀** designates the minimal ZURE produced through observation, where observation is understood not as information extraction but as a syntactic act of irreversible cut. The relation R₀ ⇄ Z₀ is non-invertible and non-conservative, ensuring that ZURE accumulates rather than cancels.

Within this framework, time is not presupposed as a parameter but is generated when multiple symbolically active phases engage in mutual observation. Time emerges as the irreversible residue of non-synchronous syntactic interaction. Accordingly, incompleteness is not a defect of theory but a constitutive condition of approximation.

The applicability of ZURE-field theory is demonstrated through two domains: the quantum measurement problem and large language models. In both cases, phenomena traditionally treated as collapses, updates, or probabilistic outputs are reinterpreted as syntactic cuts that generate Z₀ within a ZURE-field. The theory thus reframes explanation itself as a responsible practice of incomplete approximation.

- 本論文は「場の理論」を否定しない  
- それを **通過済みの理論的地点** として位置づける  
- 問題は _何を説明するか_ ではなく  
    _どの構文が説明を可能にしているか_ にある  

This orientation functions as a traversal marker rather than an argumentative introduction.
