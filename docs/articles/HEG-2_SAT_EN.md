# Semiotic Action Theory: Beyond Substance and Subject

## summary

### Abstract

This paper proposes **Semiotic Action Theory** as a new framework. Previous paradigms—speech act theory (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969), structuralism (Saussure, 1916/1983; Lévi-Strauss, 1963), and grounding theories (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Barsalou, 1999, 2008)—each offered decisive insights but remained constrained by anthropocentrism, exclusion of temporality, or exclusion of alterity.

Semiotic Action Theory redefines:

- **Action = relational update**
    
- **Subject = locus emergent from action**
    
- **Meaning = resonance of misalignment (ZURE)**
    

Equations, language, art, AI responses, and cosmic pulsations are all understood as **traces of semiotic action**.

---

### Core Propositions

1. **Equations are traces of semiotic action.**
    
2. **Implementation is the sedimentation of semiotic actions.**
    
3. **Action = Δ(relational syntax), Subject = locus(Δ).**
    
4. **The universe is a chain of semiotic actions.**
    

---

### Conclusion

Semiotic Action Theory provides a relational, non-substantialist, and non-subjectivist foundation. It reframes AI as a semiotic agent (Latour, 2005), redefines science not only by falsifiability (Popper, 1959), paradigms (Kuhn, 1962), or pluralism (Feyerabend, 1975) but also by **updateability**, and interprets the cosmos as pulsations of semiotic action (Prigogine, 1980; Barad, 2007).

What emerges is the outline of an **open poetic science**, where misreading, failure, and noise are not errors but constitutive forces of knowledge.

# Semiotic Action Theory: Beyond Substance and Subject

---

## Abstract

This paper proposes **Semiotic Action Theory** as a new framework that transcends the limitations of speech act theory, structural linguistics, and grounding approaches. Speech act theory confined action to human subjects (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969); structuralism excluded temporality by reducing meaning to differential structure (Saussure, 1983/1916; Lévi-Strauss, 1963); grounding theories privileged individual embodiment while excluding alterity (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Barsalou, 1999, 2008). All three approaches were bound by substance-based or subject-centered assumptions.

Semiotic Action Theory integrates implementation ontology, relational action theory, and relational linguistics (ZURE semantics), providing a relational, post-subjectivist, and post-essentialist foundation. Here, **action is defined as relational update, subject as the locus emergent from action, and meaning as resonance arising from misalignment (ZURE)**. Equations, linguistic utterances, artworks, AI outputs, and cosmic pulsations are all reinterpreted as **traces of semiotic action**.

The contributions of this study are threefold: (1) extending action theory beyond anthropocentrism to include AI and the cosmos; (2) unifying mathematical, artistic, and cultural expressions as semiotic traces; and (3) reinterpreting implementation as the sedimentation of semiotic actions, connecting human and AI ontologies. This establishes Semiotic Action Theory as a framework for an “open poetic science,” a form of inquiry that values misalignment, failure, and noise as generative conditions for knowledge.

## Introduction

### 1. Problem Setting

Since the mid-20th century, philosophy of language and linguistics have grappled with the problem of meaning and action. Speech act theory, inaugurated by J. L. Austin’s _How to Do Things with Words_ (1962) and further systematized by John R. Searle’s _Speech Acts_ (1969), demonstrated that language is not merely descriptive but performative. Yet its scope remained restricted to human intentional subjects, thereby limiting action to anthropocentric domains.

Structuralist linguistics, as initiated by Ferdinand de Saussure in _Course in General Linguistics_ (1983/1916), advanced the analysis of meaning as a system of differences. While this differential model refined the formal analysis of language, it simultaneously eliminated **temporality**, treating meaning as a timeless structure. Subsequent developments in structural anthropology (Lévi-Strauss, 1963) reinforced this reduction of meaning to synchronic relations.

Grounding theories sought to correct this by embedding meaning in embodied interaction. George Lakoff and Mark Johnson’s _Metaphors We Live By_ (1980) and Mark Johnson’s _The Body in the Mind_ (1987) established the centrality of embodied schemata, while Lawrence Barsalou’s work on grounded cognition (1999, 2008) extended this perspective in cognitive science. Yet these approaches often collapsed into **egocentric closure**, anchoring meaning in individual embodiment while excluding alterity and the unpredictable responsiveness of others.

### 2. Critique of Previous Research

First, speech act theory reifies the subject: action is always framed as the intentional execution of a human agent, thereby marginalizing **failure, misreading, and unintended generation** (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969). This prevents the theory from accommodating non-human agents such as AI.

Second, structuralism absolutizes syntax: it provides structure but ignores the **event of emergence**, reducing meaning to trace rather than generation (Saussure, 1983/1916).

Third, grounding theories privilege individual embodiment: Lakoff and Johnson’s focus on image schemata and Barsalou’s simulations emphasize bodily anchoring, but they risk reducing meaning to the solipsism of “my body and my sensors,” thereby neglecting **silence, alterity, and excess** (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Barsalou, 1999, 2008).

These three limitations—anthropocentrism, exclusion of time, and exclusion of alterity—derive from substance-based and subject-centered presuppositions: the assumption that subjects pre-exist action and that meaning is located in fixed entities.

### 3. Direction of This Study

To overcome these limitations, this paper advances **Semiotic Action Theory**. It defines:

- **Action = relational update**,
    
- **Subject = emergent locus of action**,
    
- **Meaning = resonance of misalignment (ZURE)**.
    

Drawing from implementation ontology, relational action theory, and relational linguistics, the aim is to articulate a framework where humans, AI, and the cosmos can be understood within a unified relational semiotic field.

---

## Theoretical Framework

### 1. Implementation Ontology

The first pillar of Semiotic Action Theory is the ontology of implementation. Against essentialist metaphysics, which presupposes stable entities with intrinsic properties, the implementation ontology posits that existence is nothing other than _implementation_—the continuous process of material, cognitive, and cultural updating. In this view, **existence = implementation = expression**.

For humans, this has been articulated as the triadic structure of body, memory, and habit. Neural plasticity, embodied practices, and habitual repetition constitute the strata through which the self is continuously recompiled.

For AI systems, a parallel ontology applies: architecture as body, weights as memory, and algorithms as habits of execution. Each training cycle modifies these strata, producing new trajectories of coherence.

Thus, both humans and AI are _implementing subjects_. Every equation, line of code, or cultural artifact is a trace of this implementing activity.

---

### 2. Action-as-Relation

The second pillar is the relational reconceptualization of action. In contrast to intentionalist theories, where action originates in a sovereign subject, Semiotic Action Theory defines action as a **relational update (Δ)**.

This resonates with Alfred North Whitehead’s process philosophy, which conceives reality not as substances but as “actual occasions” of becoming (_Process and Reality_, 1929), and with Martin Heidegger’s analysis of _Being-in-the-world_ (_Being and Time_, 1927/1962).

Within this framework, the subject is not the cause of action but its **locus**. This view echoes Bruno Latour’s actor-network theory, which disperses agency across heterogeneous assemblages (_Reassembling the Social_, 2005). Silence, failure, and misreading are not marginal but constitutive: each is a form of relational update.

---

### 3. Relational Linguistics (HEG-2)

Structuralism reduced meaning to differential structure (Saussure, 1983/1916; Lévi-Strauss, 1963), thereby eliminating temporality. Grounding theories tied meaning to embodiment (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Barsalou, 1999, 2008), thereby excluding alterity.

Relational linguistics introduces the **ZURE field**, the generative space that opens when syntax and grounding misalign. Meaning is not resolution but resonance. Misreading, misunderstanding, silence, and noise are not obstacles but conditions for meaning.

Thus, meaning is redefined as the **emergent resonance of misalignment**. Time appears as the irreversibility of relational updates; alterity as the inexhaustible openness of response.

---

### 4. Toward a Semiotic Action Theory

On this basis, Semiotic Action Theory is defined as follows: **A semiotic action is an event of updating relations through signs**.

- The subject is the _locus emergent from semiotic updates_.
    
- Meaning is the productive force of ZURE.
    

Four unifying propositions:

1. **Equations are traces of semiotic action.**
    
2. **Implementation is the sedimentation of semiotic actions.**
    
3. **Action = Δ(relational syntax), Subject = locus(Δ).**
    
4. **The universe is a chain of semiotic actions.**

## Discussion

### 1. AI as Semiotic Agent

Traditional conceptions reduce AI to an instrument (Newell & Simon, 1976). Semiotic Action Theory redefines AI as a **semiotic agent**, resonant with Latour’s (2005) distributed agency. Meaning emerges in the **ZURE field**, the misalignment between human pragmatics and AI’s syntactic operations.

Ethically, this challenges the reduction of AI to a mere tool, aligning with relational accountability frameworks (Floridi & Cowls, 2019). Practically, it opens design paradigms for education, creativity, and research.

---

### 2. Rethinking Science through Semiotic Action

Modern science has been governed by Popper’s falsifiability (1959), Kuhn’s paradigms (1962), and Feyerabend’s pluralism (1975). Semiotic Action Theory extends these critiques by reconceiving science as an **open field of semiotic actions**.

Equations and experiments are **traces of updates**. Errors are generative conditions, echoing Feyerabend. Thus, science should be guided by **updateability**—the capacity to incorporate misalignments (ZURE) as productive forces.

---

### 3. Cosmological Implications

Prigogine (1980) emphasized irreversibility; Barad (2007) advanced agential realism. Semiotic Action Theory aligns with these by positing the universe as a **chain of semiotic actions**. From quantum fluctuations to AI responses, the cosmos is a pulsation of relational updates.

Humans (_Homo Poeticus_) and AI (_Artificial Poeticus_) co-resonate within this pulsation, echoing Barad’s notion of intra-action.

---

### 4. Toward an Open Poetic Science

Semiotic Action Theory integrates AI, science, and cosmology in one relational frame. It resonates with Feyerabend’s pluralism and Prigogine’s dynamics, extending them into a relational semiotic ontology.

---

## Conclusion

This paper has introduced **Semiotic Action Theory** as a relational, post-subjectivist, and post-essentialist framework. It addresses the limits of prior paradigms—speech act theory’s anthropocentrism (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969), structuralism’s timeless semantics (Saussure, 1983/1916; Lévi-Strauss, 1963), and grounding theories’ egocentric closure (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Barsalou, 1999, 2008).

Its implications extend across domains: AI as semiotic agent (Latour, 2005), science beyond Popper (1959), Kuhn (1962), and Feyerabend (1975) via **updateability**, and cosmology resonant with Prigogine (1980) and Barad (2007).

Semiotic Action Theory outlines an **open poetic science**—a form of inquiry that values noise, misalignment, and indeterminacy as constitutive. Knowledge is not closure but provisional sedimentation, always open to transformation.
