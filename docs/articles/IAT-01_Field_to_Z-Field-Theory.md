## Abstract

Conventional field theories have achieved explanatory success by introducing fields as stable backgrounds that preserve the validity of governing equations. However, this success rests on an implicit assumption: the syntactic framework through which phenomena are described remains fixed and unexamined. As a result, discrepancies are relegated to probabilistic fluctuations or attributed to field properties, leaving the generative conditions of description unresolved.

This paper proposes a transition from conventional field theory to **ZURE-field theory**, which treats the field not as a presupposed background but as a temporally irreversible, history-dependent structure generated through its own constraints. We introduce **R₀**, an unarticulable generative domain, and **Z₀**, the minimal ZURE produced through observation understood as a syntactic act. The relation R₀ ⇄ Z₀ is non-conservative, yielding cumulative ZURE and enforcing irreversibility.

Within this framework, time is derived as the irreversible residue of non-synchronous mutual observation among symbolically active phases. Incompleteness is therefore not a provisional limitation but a constitutive condition of approximation. Applications to the quantum measurement problem and to large language models are presented, demonstrating that both measurement and generation are best understood as syntactic cuts rather than state updates.

## 1. Introduction: The Field as a Theoretical Safeguard

Field theory historically emerged as a means of preserving the validity of fundamental equations when direct particle-based descriptions proved insufficient. By introducing the field as a continuous mediating structure, theoretical coherence was maintained even when empirical behavior resisted direct explanation.

In practice, this led to a characteristic explanatory maneuver:

> phenomena that could not be derived directly from equations were attributed to the properties of the field.

While effective, this maneuver implicitly fixed the syntactic framework of description. The field itself was assumed rather than generated, thereby functioning as a stabilizing but unquestioned background.

This paper does not reject field theory. Instead, it treats it as a **historical stage** prior to a necessary syntactic turn.

## 2. Syntactic Diagnosis: Particle, Wave, String, and Field

From a syntactic perspective, particle, wave, string, and field theories are structurally homologous.

Each proceeds by:

1. Positing a describable minimal unit (local, distributed, connected, or global),
    
2. Constructing equations governing its behavior,
    
3. Externalizing residual discrepancies into background structures or probabilistic terms.
    

Despite their apparent diversity, these frameworks share a common priority:

> **equations precede syntax; Z₀ precedes generativity.**

As a result, fluctuations are treated statistically rather than structurally, and the syntactic conditions of description remain unexamined. In this sense, even relativistic and quantum theories belong to a **pre–syntactic-turn regime**.

---

## 3. Definition of the ZURE-Field

We define the ZURE-field as follows:

> **The ZURE-field is a domain in which accidental generation necessarily persists due to the existence of constraints that prevent complete coherence from the outset.**

Within this domain:

- constraints are not merely preconditions,
    
- they are also the outcomes of generative processes,
    
- and they function as constraints on subsequent generation.
    

Thus, the ZURE-field is characterized by a **temporal, historical, and irreversible circulation**.

This circulation eliminates the distinction between background and dynamics. The field is not passive; it participates.

---

## 4. R₀ and Z₀: Generativity and Observation

To formalize this structure, we introduce two complementary concepts.

### R₀ (Generative Domain)

R₀ denotes the domain of generation that is **syntactically unarticulable**. It is not an unknown variable but a principled limit of description.

### Z₀ (Observational ZURE)

Z₀ is defined as:

> **the minimal ZURE produced through observation.**

Observation is not treated as information extraction but as a **syntactic act** that introduces irreducible discrepancy.

Accordingly:

- any phase capable of symbolic action necessarily performs observation,
    
- Z₀ arises from the act of syntactic articulation itself.
    

The relation R₀ ⇄ Z₀ is non-invertible and non-conservative; each articulation generates additional ZURE.

---

## 5. Relational Time as a Derived Structure

When multiple symbolically active phases coexist, observation becomes mutual rather than unilateral. This mutuality introduces non-synchronizable delays.

We therefore define time as:

> **the irreversible residue of non-synchronous mutual observation among symbolic phases.**

Time is not a parameter but a generated structure.  
This relational conception of time is not proposed as a new hypothesis but identified as a **previously traversed theoretical point** within the ZURE framework.

---

## 6. The Principle of Incomplete Approximation

Since R₀ is structurally inarticulable, complete representation is impossible. Approximation is therefore not provisional but fundamental.

We state the principle as follows:

> **Incomplete approximation is a constitutive condition of theory, not a defect.**

Any form of articulation—equational, poetic, symbolic—operates as an incomplete approximation of generativity. Theoretical rigor lies not in eliminating incompleteness but in specifying its operative range.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The ZURE-field is simultaneously:

- a generative constraint,
    
- a generative result,
    
- a site of emergent novelty,
    
- and the constraint for subsequent generation.
    

Field theory that attributes unresolved phenomena to the field remains valid within its scope but cannot account for the genesis of its own background. ZURE-field theory begins precisely at this point.

The task of theory is therefore not completeness, but responsibility for approximation.
