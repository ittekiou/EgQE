# PS-02｜Survivability Imperative: Short Technical Note  
Mathematical Modeling of Responsibility and Preliminary Case Study  

---

## 📝 Abstract
This short technical note reports the initial implementation of the **Survivability Imperative**, a mathematical model of responsibility.  
Building on the three layers of responsibility (Consistency, Alterity, and Historicity), we position **Historicity = Survivability** as the highest principle.  
By modeling future-oriented decisions under crisis, we demonstrate through simulation that the **Triple-Jump Principle (Detection → Correction → Landing)** achieves faster stabilization and short-tail error reduction compared to traditional Fixed/Dynamic control modes.

## 🌌 Background
- Three-layered structure of responsibility: Consistency < Alterity < Historicity (Survivability)  
- Extension of the Indefinite Imperative towards the Survivability Imperative  
- Triple-Jump Principle: enabling non-linear leaps into the future without succumbing to crisis  

---

## 📐 Mathematical Model
- Future-weighting parameter γ in the adjustment circuit  
- Leap control: non-linear update of future_weight in up to three stages  
- Threshold rule to prevent redundant actions (70% support + 30% opposition)  

---

## 📊 Case Study: 30% Adversarial Scenario
- **Condition**: 30% adversarial elements introduced in the input sequence  
- **Comparison**: Fixed vs Dynamic vs Leap  
- **Results**:  
  - Fixed / Dynamic → residual error spikes remain  
  - Leap (Triple-Jump) → non-linear adjustment of future_weight achieves early convergence and error short-tail reduction  

---

## 🔎 Discussion
- **Control Implication**: Leap functions as an alternative to hysteresis, achieving symbolic stabilization with simple mechanics.  
- **Ethical Implication**: By placing Survivability at the top, responsibility transcends mere reactive duty and enables discontinuous transitions into the future.

## ✅ Conclusion & Future Work
This note serves as a **preliminary record** of mathematical modeling and early case validation of the Survivability Imperative.  
Future work includes:  
1. Case study with 50% adversarial rate  
2. Crisis mode (sudden disruptive scenarios)  
3. Comparative analysis with hysteresis-based control  

These will be integrated into the forthcoming **PS-02 Full Paper**.
