# Gravity Is Not a Force: A Lag-Based Reclassification of Gravity, Attraction, and Free Fall

> **Cover Letter**
> 
> This work does not propose a new force, a modification of general relativity, or a theory of quantum gravity.  
> Instead, it repositions gravity as a lag-sedimented environmental condition within an observer–object $S′–O′$ framework.  
> By treating gravitational, inertial, free-fall, and centrifugal phenomena as outcomes of distinct observational lag configurations rather than as interactions or fields, the present approach allows a unified reclassification without introducing additional dynamical entities.  
> In this sense, the contribution of this work is not the construction of a new theory, but the removal of a long-standing syntactic misplacement in the description of gravity.
