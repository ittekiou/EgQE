Recent Radiation General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of black hole accretion represent one of the most comprehensive efforts to model extreme astrophysical environments within a fully relativistic and radiatively coupled framework. By incorporating spacetime curvature, magnetized plasma dynamics, and radiation transport, these studies faithfully implement the contemporary cosmological requirement that physical systems be described as closed, self-consistent, and computationally enumerable.

A notable and robust outcome of these simulations is that increasing physical completeness does not lead to greater structural closure. Instead, the resulting solutions systematically exhibit geometrically thick accretion flows, reduced radiative efficiency, multiphase stratification, and pronounced anisotropy. Importantly, these characteristics arise as converged and numerically stable solutions, rather than as artifacts of insufficient resolution or incomplete modeling.

From a cosmological perspective, the primary significance of this result lies not in the identification of a novel accretion regime, but in the clarification of a structural boundary of calculability. Even when spacetime dynamics, magnetic fields, and radiation are jointly and consistently treated, the system resists reduction to a compact, efficiently interpretable, and globally closed description.

In this sense, the simulations function as boundary indicators for contemporary computational cosmology. They demonstrate that the explanatory power of fully enumerated models is intrinsically limited, not by technical shortcomings, but by the emergence of structural complexity that exceeds efficient recovery of globally coherent meaning from local dynamical variables.

Accordingly, these results suggest that progress in computational cosmology depends not only on increasing physical fidelity, but also on recognizing the implicit constraints under which calculability itself remains viable. The work therefore contributes less to cosmological model construction than to the precise identification of the conceptual and structural limits within which such models can operate.
