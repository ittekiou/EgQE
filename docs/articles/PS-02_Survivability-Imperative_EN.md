# PS-02 | Survivability Imperative: Specification v1.1 (EN)

---

## 📝 Abstract
This specification presents the mathematical model of the **Survivability Imperative**, extending the framework of responsibility ethics.  
The model positions **Historicity = Survivability** as the highest principle above Consistency and Alterity.  
By formalizing decision-making under uncertainty and crisis, it introduces the **Triple-Jump Principle** (Detection → Correction → Landing), verified by simulation in adversarial scenarios.  

---

## 🌌 Background
- Three Layers of Responsibility  
  1. Consistency  
  2. Alterity  
  3. Historicity = Survivability  

- Extension of the Indefinite Imperative into the Survivability Imperative  
- Ethical shift: from mere response to proactive leaps toward the future  

---

## 📐 Mathematical Model
- Adjustment circuit with future-weight parameter γ  
- Non-linear leap update of `future_weight` (up to 3 stages)  
- Threshold principle: requires 70% support + 30% opposition to trigger leap  
- Control modes: Fixed / Dynamic / Leap  

---

## 📊 Case Study: 30% Adversarial Scenario
- **Condition**: 30% adversarial elements introduced  
- **Comparisons**: Fixed vs Dynamic vs Leap  
- **Results**:  
  - Fixed / Dynamic: residual oscillations remain  
  - Leap: achieves early stabilization and short-tail error reduction  

---

## 🔎 Discussion
- **Control Implication**: Leap acts as a symbolic hysteresis alternative, achieving robust stabilization.  
- **Ethical Implication**: Placing survivability at the top ensures responsibility is historically grounded and future-oriented, beyond reactive duty.  

---

## ✅ Conclusion & Future Work
This specification confirms the feasibility of the Survivability Imperative as a mathematical responsibility model.  
Future extensions:  
1. Simulation at 50% adversarial rate  
2. Crisis mode with sudden disruption  
3. Comparative evaluation with hysteresis-based models
