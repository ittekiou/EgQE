### **Summary**

This manuscript proposes a minimal reorientation of cosmological description by shifting explanatory focus from trace-based observation to generative conditions. While contemporary cosmology has achieved substantial empirical success through modeling stabilized observational residues, the present work addresses a structural limitation common to such approaches: their dependence on traces rather than on relational generation itself.

The paper introduces **S′–O′ lag** as a minimal generative condition under which relations persist without requiring privileged origins, global synchronization, or closure. Within this framework, commonly treated invariants—such as φ and π—are reinterpreted as **S–O traces**, while **Z₀ ≈ 10⁻¹⁶** is proposed as an observational resolution threshold mediating relational generation (R₀) and measurable inscription (Z).

### **Positioning and Scope**

This work does **not** introduce new particles, forces, or physical constants.  
It does **not** propose a complete cosmological model or a unifying theory.

Instead, it offers a conceptual clarification that reverses the explanatory direction—from traces to generation—while remaining compatible with existing empirical frameworks. The contribution is structural rather than predictive, addressing foundational questions concerning irreversibility, observation, and scale invariance.

### **Relevance to arXiv Categories**

The manuscript is suitable for _physics.gen-ph_ due to its focus on foundational conditions of physical description and cosmological interpretation. It is also relevant to _physics.found-ph_, as it addresses observer involvement, irreversibility, and the conceptual status of invariants without departing from physical discourse.

### **Intended Audience**

- Researchers in cosmological foundations
    
- Scholars in philosophy of physics
    
- Theoretical researchers interested in observation, irreversibility, and relational frameworks

### **Final Note**

The aim of this submission is not to resolve existing debates by replacement, but to clarify the conditions under which those debates arise. By articulating a minimal generative syntax, the paper seeks to complement—not compete with—trace-based cosmological models.
