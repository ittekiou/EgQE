# Pulse → Trace → Spiral  
*Supplement to Anti-Time Theory*

---

## Abstract
This release provides a conceptual supplement to the *Anti-Time Theory*.  
It visualizes the inevitable transformation of pulses into traces, and traces into spirals.  
The spiral is not a metaphor but the structural destiny of semiotic space.

## Figures

### Figure 1. Pulse → Trace → Spiral
![Pulse Spiral Symbol](pulse_spiral_symbol_release.png)  
*From an initial pulse, the trace emerges, and finally the spiral takes form as becoming.*

### Figure 2. Concept Figure: Pulse → Trace → Spiral
![Pulse Spiral Supplement](pulse_spiral_supplement_release.png)  
*The relation of Pulse (P1), Trace (P3), Whitespace (P2), and Becoming (P4) shows that the spiral is never closed nor linear.*
