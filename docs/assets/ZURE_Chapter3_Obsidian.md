## 3. Mathematical Formulation  
**ZURE Infection Field and floc-Syntax Dynamics**

We define the syntactic infection field Ψ on a dynamically deformed syntactic manifold, modulated by local floc curvature. The dynamics is governed by a nonlinear wave equation on a curved background.

### Core Equation:

$$
\Box_g \Psi + m_s^2 \Psi = \lambda |\Psi|^2 \Psi + \eta(x^\mu, t)
$$

### Where:

- **\( \Psi(x^\mu, t) \)**: complex infection field (ZURE wave function)  
- **\( \Box_g \)**: d’Alembert operator on floc-curved syntactic manifold  
- **\( m_s \)**: syntactic mass (a parameter denoting coherence or stability of the syntax structure)  
- **\( \lambda \)**: nonlinear self-interaction coefficient  
- **\( \eta(x^\mu, t) \)**: observation-induced pulse term, modeling sudden syntactic perturbation

### 3.1 floc Modulation and Metric Deformation

The metric on the syntactic manifold is locally modulated by floc curvature:

$$
g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} + f_{\mu \nu}(x)
$$

- **\( f_{\mu \nu}(x) \)**: local syntactic curvature encoded in floc  
- This modulation affects the propagation behavior of \( \Psi \), generating:
  - **Resonance zones** (enhanced syntactic coherence)
  - **ZURE accumulation regions** (local curvature pockets with syntactic delay)
